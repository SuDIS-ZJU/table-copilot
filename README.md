# Table Copilot

A Table Assistant Empowered by Natural Language Conditional Table Discovery

## Project Overview

Table Copilot is an end-to-end table assistant featuring precise, interactive, and personalized table search capabilities. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), we've developed a solution that integrates table discovery directly into the table assistance process.

The key innovation of our work is the introduction of Natural Language Conditional Table Discovery (NLCTD), which allows users to search for tables using natural language conditions and perform complex operations with ease.

## Our Solution

We propose Table Copilot, an LLM-based table assistant capable of advanced table discovery:

- **NLCTD Definition**: We define a new table discovery scenario named Natural Language Conditional Table Discovery (NLCTD) that accepts both natural language conditions and query tables as input.

- **LLM Integration**: We prompt LLMs with carefully designed instructions to recognize table discovery tasks and invoke appropriate discovery methods.

- **Fusion-Based Solution**: Our novel fusion method makes table discovery more intuitive and user-friendly.

- **Three-Interface System**: Table repository for data management, table search for discovery, and table processing for operations.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Conditional Table Search**: Search for tables using natural language queries with specific conditions (e.g., "CS grade above 90") without needing complex query syntax.
- **Advanced Table Fusion**: Novel fusion-based solutions for handling both natural language conditions and query tables as input.
- **Intelligent LLM Integration**: Carefully designed prompts enable LLMs to recognize table discovery tasks and invoke appropriate methods.
- **Multi-Interface System**: Access table repository, table search, and table processing through intuitive interfaces.
